# No Steam UUID
A mod that prevents the steam version from creating another uuid, when importing your save from another version.

> [!NOTE]
> This mod does nothing if your client is not the steam version.


## Building
Pre-build releases can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/zetamap/no-steam-uuid/releases). <br>
But if you want to build the mod yourself, just run the command ``./gradlew :build``. The mod file will be exported to the project root directory and named ``no-steam-uuid.jar``.
